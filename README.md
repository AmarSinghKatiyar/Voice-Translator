# 🎤 Voice Language Translator (Python)

A Python-based voice translator that listens to spoken input in one language,
translates it into another language, and speaks the translated output aloud.

This project works as a **local desktop application** and requires access to
the system microphone and speakers.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Voice input using microphone
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Language translation between multiple languages
- Text-to-speech output of translated text
- Supports a wide range of languages

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- `speech_recognition` – for voice input
- `googletrans` – for language translation
- `gTTS` – Google Text-to-Speech
- `playsound` – for audio playback
- `pyaudio` – microphone access

---

## 🌍 Supported Languages
The program supports many languages such as:

- English (`en`)
- Hindi (`hi`)
- French (`fr`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- German (`de`)
- Japanese (`ja`)
- Korean (`ko`)
- And many more...

At runtime, the program displays a full list of supported language codes.

## ⚙️ How the Program Works
1. The user selects:
   - Input language code (language spoken)
   - Output language code (language to translate into)
2. The program listens to the user's voice through the microphone
3. Speech is converted into text
4. The text is translated into the selected output language
5. The translated text is converted into speech and played as audio

📝 About the Session
- Each program run is considered a single session.
- During a session:
   - You can speak once, and the program will output the translated audio.
   - If you want multiple translations, restart the program for a new session.
- Supported languages are displayed at the start, so you can select the correct language codes.
- The session relies on an internet connection for Google Translation and Text-to-Speech services.

⚡ Notes & Tips
- Ensure quiet surroundings for better speech recognition accuracy.
- If pyaudio fails to install:
   - On Windows: install the prebuilt wheel from here
   - On Linux: sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
- googletrans may occasionally fail due to API changes; try updating to the latest release if needed.
